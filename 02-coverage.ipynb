    "In the previous notebook, we worked with a general-purpose *mathematical* programming problem for spatial optimisation, the *p-median problem*, which seeks to maximise the benefit gained from locating some number of \"depots\" required to service a set of demand points. We use binary *location* decision variables $y_j$ to represent whether or not a potential depot is selected (with $j=1...m$), and another set of *allocation* decision variables $z_{ij}$ to represent whether we serve demand point $i$ is served by depot $j$ (with $i=1...n$). Each trip from depot to demand site has some distance-based cost, $d_{ij}$, and we must carry $w_i$ units to demand site $i$ in order to fully satisfy its needs. With these symbols, we can state the P-Median problem as:\n",

    "## The unique issue of *coverage*\n",
    "\n",
    "In a $p$-median model, every demand point *must* be served by some depot. That is, all demand points are *covered* by a supply, no matter how remote the demand point is. By *covered*, we mean that the demand is able to be satisfied by the supply point, even when the distance between the demand and the supply is very large. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many optimisation problems, most clearly police or fire department planning, we cannot naively assume that very distant demand points are able to be *covered* by some supply. Indeed, we often need to ensure that every demand point is within some reasonable distance or travel time from the located facility: no house should be more than a 10 minute ambulance ride away from a hospital, for example. In this case, we might ask: how many hospitals would we need in order to ensure that no house is more than a 10-minute ambulance ride away? This is a kind of *coverage* problem (sometimes called a *set cover* problem), and is incredibly common in mathematics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To think of this practically, imagine each you have a map of your city laid out in front of you. Imagine that each hospital is like a big disc covering the area you can get to within ten minutes from that hospital. We want to place these discs onto our map in such a way that we \"cover\" every demand point with at least one disc. A \"good\" solution will ensure that we place the fewest discs possible. This is a *location set covering problem* (LSCP), since we seek to *locate* facilities necessary to *cover* a *set* of other demand points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping with the practical example, cities do not have unlimited budgets, and hospitals are quite expensive to build and maintain. If we can only locate ten hospitals, we might want to locate those ten hospitals in such a way that maximizes the amount of people they can serve to our specified service standard. That is, we may want to try to place a fixed number of hospital-discs in order to *maximize the population covered* by these discs. In this case, we have a slightly different kind of coverage problem: we have a *maximal coverage location problem* (MCLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "These two coverage problems are quite common in spatial optimisation, and require slightly different formulations to solve. We will develop the simpler one, the LSCP, first. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying a location set covering problem \n",
    "\n",
    "The LSCP is quite simple to specify. Using the same symbols from our P-Median problem above, let us imagine we have $y_j$ sites where we can locate a potential facility, and $d_{ij}$ reflects the travel time from facility $j$ to demand point $i$. Then, let's imagine that we have some \"service standard\" $S$ that determines whether $d_{ij}$ is \"short enough\" for facility $j$ to cover demand $i$. That is, let's define a new term, $\\eta_i$, which describes the facilities *in the neighborhood of $i$* that are close enough to serve $i$. Mathematically, we spell this as $\\eta_i = \\{j \\ |\\ d_{ij} \\leq S\\}$, which is read like: \"the set of $j$ where $d_{ij}$ is less than $S$\". The symbol $\\{...\\}$ indicates that we're talking about a set of things within the curly braces, and the vertical line in something like $a|b$ means that we're looking for $a$-type things on the left that obey the condition $b$ given on the right. With this in mind, we can define an LSCP to minimize the number of facilities we site that cover all of our demand points:\n",

    "Here, our objective function represents the number of facilities (hospitals, in our discussion above) that we locate. You can see that this problem has fewer *explicit* constraints than the P-Median problem we discussed before, but the \"allocation\" part of the decision is made implicitly/automatically. By constraint 1, all of the demand sites that can be served by $j$, will be served $j$. More than one supply can be serve a demand, too. And, note that distance does not directly enter into the LSCP beyond allowing us to define $\\eta_i$ *before we try to solve the model*. Thus, the LSCP is easy to think of as a pure \"locational\" optimisation problem, without any \"allocation\" component that we must choose. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying a maximal coverage location problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Maximum Coverage location problem (MCLP) is more similar in specification to a $p$-median problem, in that we require a few more constraints than the LSCP. Since we can choose *not* to cover any demand, we need to use an \"allocation\" decision variable to keep track of whether or not a given demand point is \"allocated\" to a supply site. Let's refer to this as $X_{i}$, which is a binary variable indicating whether $x_i$ is considered \"covered.\" Then, we can state an MCLP by maximizing the total demand covered by $p$ facilities $y_j$: \n",

    "Here, our objective function represents the total demand that we have served. You can see that this problem still has fewer *explicit* constraints than the P-Median problem we discussed before, but the \"allocation\" part of the decision is again made implicitly/automatically. By constraint 1, a site can only be considered \"covered\" if it fits within the service standard. Further, we only have a budget to locate $p$ facilities (constraint 2). Thus, the MCLP gets us a *step closer* to a $p$-median style problem, but we still have a maximum distance past which we cannot allocate, which changes the nature of the allocation decision. Further, this is a *maximization problem*, like the knapsack problem we discussed in the first notebook. This means that we seek to find the *largest population possible* that is covered by a solution. "

    "Coverage problems are a kind of *spatial optimisation* problem that occur when trying to ensure that individuals can access critical infrastructure within a given travel time or distance. It requires mainly *location* decisions (where to place facilities), since *allocation* decisions (what client is served by what facility) are made implicitly based on the constraint on the maximum travel distance. As such, is it considered a fundamental *location-allocation* problem, and has structures common to many different kinds of spatial optimisation problems, such as the transportation problem or the warehouse location problem. The Location Set Cover Problem (LSCP) focuses on trying to locate as few facilities as possible in order to cover demand points within a given service distance. The Maximal Cover Location Problem (MCLP) tries to cover as many people as possible given a fixed number of facilities and service distance requirement. Coverage problem can be stated and solved easily in Python using the `spopt` library, which wraps the large amount of constraint and variable declarations required to build the $p$-Median model in the underlying `pulp` package. It supports many variants of the LSCP and MCLP problems, including cases where the client sites are not the same as the facility sites and the use of travel time/routing distances.  "
